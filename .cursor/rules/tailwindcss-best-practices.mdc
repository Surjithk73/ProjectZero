- Always use **utility-first CSS** for consistent, maintainable styles.
- Create reusable **custom components** using `@apply`.
- Optimize for **mobile-first design** using responsive utilities.
- Use **JIT mode** and **purge unused styles** for performance optimization.
- Leverage **Tailwindâ€™s dark mode** support with `dark:` classes.
- Use **aria attributes and semantic HTML** for accessibility.
- Prefer **CSS variables (`theme()`)** for better maintainability.
- Minimize excessive class usage by combining styles efficiently.
- Use **aspect ratio utilities** (`aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9`) for images and videos.
