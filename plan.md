## Project Description

ProjectZero is an innovative AI-powered platform that empowers users to voice or type their startup and product ideas, receiving instant, actionable insights. The platform provides comprehensive analysis—including competitor research, market viability, and risk assessments—while doubling as an idea manager for saving, refining, and exploring concepts. With AI-assisted mentorship, it evaluates business potential, identifies market gaps, and assesses feasibility. Users can share their ideas with a community, explore others' submissions or AI-generated concepts, and manage their creative journey through an intuitive dashboard. ProjectZero seamlessly blends idea brainstorming, market research, and competitor analysis into one user-friendly experience.
