- Always use Next.js 14+ and its latest stable features.
- Use the App Router for better performance and simpler routing.
- Prefer **React Server Components (RSC)** and **Server Actions** where possible.
- Minimize the use of `"use client"` to only small, isolated components.
- Use **React Suspense and streaming** for improved loading states.
- Implement **error boundaries** to gracefully handle runtime errors.
- Optimize images using the **Next.js `<Image />` component**.
- Implement **incremental static regeneration (ISR)** where needed.
- Use **middleware** for authentication and route protection.
- Leverage **Next.js built-in SEO** features like metadata, sitemaps, and OG tags.
- Implement structured data using **JSON-LD** for SEO optimization.
- Always add **loading and error states** to async components.
- Use **dynamic imports** (`next/dynamic`) to optimize performance.
- Keep components **modular and reusable** for maintainability.
